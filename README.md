# SpiderManGame Contract
SpiderManGame is a Solidity smart contract that facilitates a simple game where players can join the game, start the game, defeat the villain, and end the game. The contract is designed to be owned by an address, allowing the owner to control the game's progression.
## Features

- **Ownership**: The contract inherits from the OpenZeppelin Ownable contract, allowing for ownership management.
- **Game Management**: The contract enables players to join the game, allows the owner to start the game, defeat the villain, and end the game.
- **Events**: The contract emits events to notify external parties about significant state changes, such as player joins and villain defeats.

## Functionality

### Constructor

- The constructor initializes the contract with the address of the initial owner, who is set as Spider-Man by default.
- It sets initial values for the number of players and the game status.

### joinGame

- Function `joinGame()` allows players to join the game by incrementing the number of players and emitting a `PlayerJoined` event.
- Players can only join if the game is not already in progress.

### startGame

- Function `startGame()` allows the owner to start the game.
- Requires a minimum of one player to start the game.

### defeatVillain

- Function `defeatVillain()` allows the owner to mark the villain as defeated and end the game.
- Emits a `VillainDefeated` event.
- Can only be called if the game is in progress.

### endGame

- Function `endGame()` allows the owner to manually end the game without defeating the villain.

## Usage

1. Deploy the SpiderManGame contract, specifying the initial owner address.
2. Players can join the game using the `joinGame` function.
3. Once enough players have joined, the owner can start the game using the `startGame` function.
4. The owner can mark the villain as defeated using the `defeatVillain` function.
5. The owner can end the game at any time using the `endGame` function.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that only trusted addresses are assigned as the initial owner, as they have full control over the game.
- Verify that the game logic meets the desired requirements and cannot be manipulated by malicious actors.

## Dependencies

This contract utilizes the Ownable contract from the OpenZeppelin Contracts library for ownership management.
